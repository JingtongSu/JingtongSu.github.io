- I'm from Changchun, Jilin, a beautiful city located at northeastern China. Before coming to PKU, I spent 6 years in the Middle School Attached to Northeast Normal University (MSANNU).

- I've been playing the piano since I was 4 years old. I passed the 9th-grade examination organized by the Central Conservatory of Music, which is the highest degree an amateur piano player can pursue in China.

- I attended the Chinese Physics Olympiad and obtained a Gold Medal when I was in high school. Because of this, I have maintained an interest in physics and have also self-studied some fascinating physics courses.
